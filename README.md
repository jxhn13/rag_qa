# Introduction 
RAG-Based QA Bot
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering (QA) bot. The system allows users to upload documents, which are indexed in a vector database (Pinecone) and used in conjunction with a generative model (Cohere) to answer questions by retrieving relevant documents and generating contextual answers.
Features
Document Upload: Users can upload multiple documents.
Semantic Search: Pinecone is used to store vector representations of documents.
Contextual Responses: Cohere generates human-like responses based on the retrieved content.
Multiple Endpoints: Separate services for document upload, user login, and chat functionality.
Frontend-Backend Communication: React frontend for interacting with the backend services.
# Getting Started
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
Node.js and npm
Docker (for containerization)
Pinecone API Key (For vector database usage)
Cohere API Key (For generating answers)

Ensure you have the following environment variables set:

PINECONE_API_KEY: Your Pinecone API key
COHERE_API_KEY: Your Cohere API key


# Build and Test
Frontend (React)
Install dependencies:

Before building the project, make sure all dependencies are installed. Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
npm install

Build the React App:

To create a production-ready build, run:
npm run build

Backend (Flask)
Install dependencies:

Navigate to each backend service directory (e.g., chat, upload, login) and install the dependencies as follows:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask Services:

After installing the dependencies, run each service (e.g., upload, login, chat) using:

python app.py

Docker
ou can also build and run the application using Docker. In the root directory, run docker-compose build.

To start the containers, run docker-compose up. This will spin up all the necessary services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

Testing the Project
Frontend Tests
If you have any unit tests written for your React app, you can run them using npm test. This will execute all the test cases and provide you with a coverage report.

Backend Tests
For backend testing, you can use a testing framework like pytest. Navigate to the specific backend service directory and run pytest to execute all the test cases.

Integration Tests
Ensure that the backend services are running. Use a tool like Postman or curl to test the endpoints (e.g., for document upload, login, and chat functionality).

Docker Testing
To ensure that your application works within Docker, follow these steps:

Build the Docker containers: docker-compose build.
Run the Docker containers: docker-compose up.
Test the application by accessing http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and interacting with the backend services.
